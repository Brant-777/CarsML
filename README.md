## Machine Learning Linear Regression Using Tensorflow.js

## About

CarsML is a machine learning project used to create a linear regression solution to find the most accurate fit for the  relationship betweeen MPG and Weight of vechicles. In this example we use HTML, Tensorflow.js and Kaggle.json Data.

## Key Takeaways - Machine Learning Model(Linear Regression)

When using a machine learning model before inputing data it requires data cleaning to insert into the models inner layers. After the 2d tensor data/vector is placed into the neural network it is weighted through each connection using the weighted sum in the sigmoid function (0 not a match and greater than zero less than 1) (Fig.1). Then we train the model and see how the model performs and check the loss and mean squared error averaged over the whole dataset to the end of the epoch(Fig.2). Finally we map the predicted output vs the orginal values and test for fit and check if the finding for minimization function has accuracte output to form a linear regresssion(Fig.3) showing a strong positive correlation(when model is run for best fit).



Negative Correlation - When Y increases then feature X decreases and vice versa.
Positive Correlation - When Y decrease then feature X increase and vice versa.
