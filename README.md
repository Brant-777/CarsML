Machine Learning Linear Regression Using Tensorflow.js


CarsML is a machine learning project used to determine a linear regression relationship betweeen MPG and Weight of vechicles. In this example we use HTML, Tensorflow.js and 

Key Takeaways - Machine Learning Model(Linear Regression)

A machine learning model before inputing data requires data cleaning to insert into the model inner layers. After the 2d tensor data/vector is placed into the neural network it is weighted through each connection using the weighted sum in the sigmoid function (0 not a match and greater than zero less than 1). Then we train the model and see how the model performs and check the loss and mean squared error averaged over the whole dataset to the end of the epoch. Finally we map the predicted output vs the orginal values and test for fit and check if the finding for minimization function has accuracte output to form a linear regresssion(see ex. c) showing a strong positive correlation.
